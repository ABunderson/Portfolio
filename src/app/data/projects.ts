      'This used to be a basic WordPress site with a white background and basic blue accents color scheme. The biggest concern of the author was how simple it looked. The color scheme and some awkward spacing were the first things we focused on. I designed several color schemes based on the books in the series and the author picked a dark color scheme based on his second book. This has been implemented all over his site with no downtime.',

I worked as a florist part-time and talking people through the process of ordering dance flowers is an arduous experience and having a site that walks people through all the steps with pictures would make it so much easier. I ran out of time to finish it as it was much more ambitious than I realized. I spent around 160 hours on the site. The front end is complete and the backend is halfway done. The design was based off of the site of the florist I worked at.',
